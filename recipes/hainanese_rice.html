    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I dedicate the recipe to my mom, especially because she's the one who taught me. Every year for Chinese New Year, this was the main dish, and I always loved the way it smelled and of course tasted. 
        I could physically not wait until it was time to eat, because after we prayed and set the incense, my mom would say we had to wait about 15 minutes or so, to wait for our ancestors to eat first. 
        I always imagined the spirits of my grandparents who I had never met, eating right in front of me - it was a fascinating experience but one of my favorites growing up. One of my favorite things about this dish is although it's so flavorful, it is still
        light on the stomach and leaves you feeling satisfied AND refreshed, especially thanks to the holy grail combination of garlic and ginger. If I don't end up with a husband, I would just marry garlic and be happy with my life.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken (you can also just use a pack of chicken thighs or breasts)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>Sesame oil</li>
        <li>White rice</li>
        <li>Garlic, minced (5-7 cloves)</li>
        <li>Ginger, minced (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Chicken broth</li>
        <li>Avocado or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Garnish options: additional fried garlic, scallions, fried onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start with making a garlic-ginger oil. Heat the oil in a wok over medium heat, then add the ginger and fry for 1 minute, then the garlic. Fry until the garlic is light golden, then remove the garlic and ginger trying to keep as much of the oil as possible. You might want to consider using a strainer here.</li>
        <li>Pour the raw grains of white rice into the wok, and fry it. The point of this is to get the grains of rice crispy, which enhances their flavor and makes the cooked rice even fluffier. Fry the rice over medium-high heat until you can see some opacity (the grains will look more white, maybe slightly golden). At this point, remove the rice and pour it into a rice cooker or large pot.</li>
        <li>Poach the chicken. Depending on which option, let it simmer on low heat for at least 15 minutes, checking it periodically to make sure it's not being overcooked or undercooked.</li>
        <li>To the pot of cooked raw rice, add the chicken broth and as much water as you need to, to raise the water level to 1 fingertip depth. (Place your finger in the water, if your fingertip is touching the rice and the water comes up to the first crease of your finger, this is a good amount.)</li>
        <li>Let the rice cook, and prepare the sauce. Mix the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sesame oil into a small bowl.</li>
        <li>When the rice is done, add the mixed garlic and ginger, and mix.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, with sliced pieces of the poached chicken and the sauce on the side. Enjoy with your garnishes of choice!</li>
    </ol>
