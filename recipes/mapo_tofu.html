    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish that originates from Sichuan Province, in the Southern regions of China. Here, spicy food is life, and one spice that distinguishes it from others is the Sichuan Peppercorn. It provides a numbing, savory sensation to the tongue, instead of making your tongue feel like it's on fire.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable oil (1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>Sichuan peppercorns (1/2 - 1 1/2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Ginger (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Garlic (3 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Ground pork (8 ounces)</li>
        <li>Low sodium chicken broth (2/3 cup)</li>
        <li>Spicy bean sauce (1-2 tablespoons)</li>
        <li>Silken tofu (1 pound)</li>
        <li>Cornstarch (1 1/2 teaspoons)</li>
        <li>Sesame oil (1/4 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Sugar (1/4 teaspoon)</li>
        <li>Scallion (2-3 stalks)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat some oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger, then after 1 minute add the garlic. Fry for 1 minute, then turn the heat to high and add the ground pork. Separate the meat and fry it until it's cooked through. Add the Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Then add 2/3 cups of chicken broth anad stir. Let the mixture simmer for a minute. While this is simmering, prepare the tofu (cut into medium sized cubes) and prepare a small bowl of water to mix in the cornstarch. Mix the cornstarch powder until it's combined.</li>
        <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to the wok and stir. Let it bubble and watch for the sauce to start getting thicker. You can always adjust the thickness by adding water, or more cornstarch, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Add in some chili oil if you'd like. Otherwise, go ahead and add your tofu, gently tossing it so it doesn't break too much. Let the mixture cook for another 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar along with the scallions, then stir for another minute.</li>
        <li>Serve with a garnish of Sichuan peppercorns and additional scallions, or however you'd like. Enjoy!</li>
